IMAPFS - Cloud storage via IMAP

IMAPFS turns an inbox on your IMAP-enabled mail server into cloud storage. This
program provides a FUSE filesystem that stores files as email messages on the
remote server.

Files are split into chunks, encrypted with AES-256, and base64 encoded before
being stored.

A few caveats exist:

Since IMAP only supports 7-bit character encoding in messages, files must be
base64 encoded. This results in a 33% overhead (only 75% of server storage space
is available).

This program relies on the SEARCH command to perform quickly. On servers where
this command is slow, or where indexing is not immediate, performance will be
very poor or some files may not appear for some time.

Read/write speed is limited by your connection to the server, as well as the
speed at which the server can retrieve/store messages.

Since IMAP does not support writing to parts of messages, a change of a single
byte in a message requires the entire message to be re-uploaded. As a result,
small, random writes will have dreadful performance. Sequential writes (i.e.
storing an entire file) are better.

This filesystem must only be mounted by one client at a time. Two devices
mounting a filesystem simultaneously will overwrite each other's changes.

To mount:
python -m imapfs [FUSE options] [-o IMAPFS OPTIONS] <mount point>

The help (-h) optin will display IMAPFS options.
To create a filesystem, add `create=true' to the IMAPFS option list.
